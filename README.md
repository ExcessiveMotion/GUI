### Project Structure

## Development
The **Frontend** and **CEF App** projects are set up to work from the root reporitory directory, so no directory changes are required to build/run both.

### Frontend [Webpack/TypeScript]
Before starting, run ```npm update``` to download all of the development dependencies.
- Run ```npm run start``` to start a live development server
- Run ```npm run build``` to build the UI in development mode
- Run ```npm run dist``` to build the UI in production mode
> Build files are written to ```./build/frontend/```

### CEF App [CMake/C++]
